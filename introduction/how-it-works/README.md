# How It Works

GibWork simplifies the collaboration between project owners and developers in the open source community. This section outlines the platform's workflow, providing a clear guide on how to effectively use GibWork for both project submissions and development contributions.

### For Project Owners

#### Posting a Bounty

1. **Project Submission:** As a project owner, your first step is to submit your open source project to GibWork. This involves providing a detailed description of your project and its goals.
2. **Creating a Bounty:** Once your project is submitted, you can create specific bounties. A bounty is a task or a set of tasks that you need help with. Clearly describe the scope of work, the skills required, and the deadline.
3. **Setting the Reward:** Assign a USDC value to each bounty. This is the amount that a developer will earn upon successful completion of the bounty.

#### Managing Submissions

* **Review Contributions:** When developers submit their work, you'll have the opportunity to review and approve the submissions.
* **Release of Funds:** Upon approval, the USDC funds will be released to the developer.

### For Developers

#### Finding and Starting Work

1. **Choosing a Bounty:** Browse the list of available bounties on GibWork and select one that matches your skills and interests.
2. **Starting Work:** Click the "Start Work" button. This action signals your commitment to the bounty and prompts you to fork the project repository.

#### Contributing to a Project

1. **Working on the Fork:** Make your changes in the forked repository, specifically in a branch that begins with "gib-". This naming convention helps maintain organization and clarity.
2. **Submitting Your Work:** Once your work is complete, create a pull request through GibWork. This will alert the project owner to review your contribution.

#### Claiming Rewards

* **Approval:** Wait for the project owner to review and approve your pull request.
* **Claiming USDC:** Upon approval, you can claim your USDC reward directly through the platform.

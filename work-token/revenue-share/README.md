# Revenue Share

Our revenue-sharing model is designed to reward token holders by distributing a portion of the companyâ€™s revenue directly to them.&#x20;

Revenue-sharing distributions are organized into distinct "Seasons," each spanning a period of 12 weeks. This structured approach allows for consistent and predictable distribution timelines.

### Revenue Distribution Model

This distribution model balances rewarding participants while ensuring that the project has the resources necessary for growth and sustainability.\
\
The allocation is divided into two primary components:

* 80% participants who stake.
* 20% growth and sustainability.&#x20;

### Seasons

Each Season is carefully monitored and evaluated to ensure fair and transparent allocation of revenue, reinforcing our commitment to community engagement and sustainability.
